        <p>
          A conference centered around the most important thing when it comes to impactful technology products: People!
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Successful technology products tell a story about humans who came together to solve complex problems that
          touch people’s lives. It’s a story of collaboration, sharing, communication and empathy. But more often than
          not, this side of the story gets overlooked in favour of programming languages or frameworks — even though
          it’s the one piece of the puzzle all successful projects have in common. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We aim to bring together people from all kinds of backgrounds and roles to discuss, share, and celebrate the
          stories and lessons learnt when humans come together.
        </p>

        <h2>Conference</h2>

        <p>
          The conference is a place for people who are interested in an exchange about human-centered
          organizations, approaches, techniques and more, in the technology space.
        </p>

        <p>
        The conference will be organized as an open-space, so every participant is a speaker and there’s no distinction
        between speakers and listeners.
        </p>

        <h2>Venue</h2>

        <p>
          It takes place at <a href="https://www.natuerlich-tagen.de/" target="_blank">Seminarzentrum Rückersbach</a>,
          which is located near Aschaffenburg, Germany, which again is ~50km away from Frankfurt am Main, a transport
          hub with a well-connected train station and airport.
        </p>

        <p>
          The venue is surrounded by beautiful nature, and can host up to 90 participants.
          The conference has the venue booked exclusively for the duration of #humansconf,
          which allows for a great atmosphere of exchange, as everyone at the venue will be a participant.
          Plus, the fact that the venue is a hotel, means there’s no additional travel between venue and accommodation
          needed, but we all can focus on the conference without having to split up in the evenings. We just stay where
          we are and use the space of the venue for whatever we like.
